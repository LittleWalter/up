    Navigate <code>up</code> the Directory Tree with Ease | Bash & Zsh Navigation Script
</h1>

`up` is a Bash and Zsh-compatible script that simplifies directory navigation up the current path. Jump multiple levels, autocomplete subdirectory names, and handle Unicode paths with ease.

`cd` is great for drilling down the directory tree with tab completion, but not as convenient going directly up. We all know it can be a pain to repeatedly use `cd ..`, `cd ../..`, `cd ../../..`, and so on. Use the `up` function instead!

These Bash scripts offer a quick, flexible, and simple way to go up the directory tree of your current working directory.

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Key Features

1. **Simple Multi-Level Navigation**:
    - Jump up multiple directory levels with a single command:
        - `up` (jumps one level)
        - `up 2` (jumps two levels)
        - `up 3` (jumps three levels)

2. **Powerful Tab Completion**:
    - Jump directly to a subdirectory name.
    - Supports Unicode directories (e.g., Êó•Êú¨Ë™û, emojis like üìÇ).
    - Auto-escapes special ASCII characters like `*`, `[`, `]`, and spaces (e.g., `![special dir]/`).
    - Quickly autocomplete subdirectory names by prefix.

3. **Verbose Output for Clarity**:
    - Use verbose mode (`-v`) to display detailed information about directory changes.
    - Get insights like the number of levels jumped, old directory (`$OLDPWD`), and new directory (`$PWD`).
    - Enable persistent verbose mode with `_UP_ALWAYS_VERBOSE=true`.

4. **Handles Edge Cases Gracefully**:
    - Navigate to `HOME` with `up ~` from any directory.
    - Subdirectories named after flags (e.g., `--help/`) or containing integers (e.g., `2/`) are supported seamlessly.

5. **Robust Error Handling**:
    - Proper exit status codes returned on errors.
    - Useful for shell configurations that utilize exit codes like the [starship](https://starship.rs/) prompt. 

6. **Compatibility**:
    - Fully compatible with both Bash and Zsh.
    - Minimal dependencies ensure fast, efficient performance, and a simple installation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Download the git repo to your preferred destination. 

Following best practices, I recommend using the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/) to reduce HOME directory clutter. Use either `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` or `XDG_DATA_HOME`, depending on where you like to keep shell scripts. (I imagine most people would place these into the former and consider these as configuration files.)

By default, `XDG_DATA_HOME` is `$HOME/.config` and `XDG_DATA_HOME` is `$HOME/.local/share`. However, these paths might not be explicitly defined in your shell configuration.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LittleWalter/up ~/.config/up
```

### Bash

Add to `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` on Apple macOS systems.

```bash
source ~/.config/up/up.bash # The `up` function
source ~/.config/up/up-completion.bash # `up` completion
```

Assuming your Bash config is at `~/.bashrc`, use this snippet to download and append the lines in one step:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LittleWalter/up ~/.config/up
echo 'source ~/.config/up/up.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'source ~/.config/up/up-completion.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### Zsh

Add to `.zshrc`.

Fully compatible with Zsh using `bashcompinit` for seamless integration.

The `autoload` lines enable autocompletion modules.

```bash
autoload -U +X compinit && compinit # Enable Zsh completion 
autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit # Enable Bash completion compatibility

source ~/.config/up/up.bash # The `up` function
source ~/.config/up/up-completion.bash # `up` completion
```

Assuming your Zsh config is at `~/.zshrc`, use this snippet to download and append the lines in one step:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/LittleWalter/up ~/.config/up
echo 'autoload -U +X compinit && compinit' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'autoload -U +X bashcompinit && bashcompinit' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'source ~/.config/up/up.bash' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'source ~/.config/up/up-completion.bash' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

For example usage, assume `pwd` command returns:

```sh
$ pwd
/Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures/wallpapers/apple
```

### üî¢ Jump to the nth directory

```sh
$ up <optional: integer>
```

#### Jumping 1 subdirectory

```sh
$ up
$ pwd
/Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures/wallpapers
```

#### Jumping 3 subdirectories

```sh
$ up 3
$ pwd
/Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB
```

### üìÇ Jump to the nearest subdirectory name

#### Display the autocomplete list
```sh
$ up <tab>
/            Pictures/    Volumes/     WD_SSD_1TB/  wallpapers/
```

#### Autocomplete subdirectory names with prefix

To autocomplete the only subdirectory that starts with `Pic`:

```sh
$ up Pic<tab>
$ up Pictures/
```

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Display help

![up --help screenshot](assets/up_help_screenshot.jpg)

```sh
$ up help
$ up -h
$ up --help
```

### üì£ Verbose mode

Just like the `cd` command, `up` will generally not output text upon successful execution.

To display extra information such as `$OLDPWD` and `$PWD` after calling `up`:

```sh
$ up verbose [integer or subdirectory name]
$ up -v [integer or subdirectory name]
$ up --verbose [integer or subdirectory name]
```

#### Verbose mode examples

```sh
$ up -v Pictures/
up: jumped 2 dirs to nearest: Pictures
old: /Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures/wallpapers/apple
pwd: /Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures
```

```sh
$ up verbose 2
up: jumped 2 dirs
old: /Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures/wallpapers/apple
pwd: /Volumes/WD_SSD_1TB/Pictures
```

#### üåê `_UP_ALWAYS_VERBOSE` environment variable

Set the optional environment flag to always display verbose mode in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`.

```bash
export _UP_ALWAYS_VERBOSE=true
```

### üè° Navigate to `HOME` directory

For the sake of completeness, navigating back to `HOME` path is included.

`HOME` is the only valid full path `up` allows; all other arguments must be a single subdirectory name.

```sh
$ up ~
$ up $HOME
$ up /home/mwallace # Unix-like example
$ up /Users/vvega   # macOS example
```

You don't have to be in a `HOME` subdirectory for this to work.

## üî¨ Testing in Bats (Bash Automated Testing System)

Tests are written for [`bats-core`](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core), a test framework for Bash.

Refer to the [official documentation of Bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) for installation information.

### üç∫ Homebrew Installation

```sh
$ brew install bats-core
```

### üèÉ Running tests

```sh
$ bats up_test.bats # Test the `up` function
$ bats up-completion_test.bats # Test the `_up` function for Bash completions
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Known Issues

There may be skill-related limitations: I‚Äôm not a Bash scripting expert.

* No color support for tab completion list
    * Could not get Zsh to use `LS_COLORS` via `zstyle` settings
* Tab completion list not in order of `PWD`
    * There‚Äôs no guarantee of the completion list order.

## ‚úÖ TODOs and üí°Future Ideas

Possible ideas to work on.

- [ ] Refactor `up.bash` to make it more readable
    * Easier to maintain or modify.
    * As it stands, the script gets the job done and is well-commented.
- [ ] Write a fish-compatible version.
    * I'm not using [fish](https://fishshell.com/) as my primary shell.
- [ ] Write a binary version of `up.bash` in a language like Go or Rust for universal shell compatibility. (Better idea?)
    * Only completion scripts for target shells would need to be created.
    * TUI `up` history: jump back to previous paths

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions and suggestions are welcome! 

For major changes, please open an issue to discuss what you‚Äôd like to improve. 

Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. Make sure to run the tests with `bats` to ensure everything works as expected.

## üçøCredits

Thanks to the original script writers and public shell configs!

### [Derek Taylor's dotfiles (dwt1 on GitLab)](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles)

Originally, I used Derek Taylor's `up` function unmodified within his [`.zshrc`](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/blob/master/.zshrc?ref_type=heads):

```bash
up () {
  local d=""
  local limit="$1"

  # Default to limit of 1
  if [ -z "$limit" ] || [ "$limit" -le 0 ]; then
    limit=1
  fi

  for ((i=1;i<=limit;i++)); do
    d="../$d"
  done

  # perform cd. Show error if cd fails
  if ! cd "$d"; then
    echo "Couldn't go up $limit dirs.";
  fi
}
```

This minimalist function works well for navigating up by the number of directories.

### [Oliver Weiler's `up` Bash scripts (helpermethod on GitHub)](https://github.com/helpermethod/up)

I later found [this simple `up` Bash script](https://github.com/helpermethod/up/blob/main/up) to navigate by subdirectory name, complete with tab completion and [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) scripts. 

```bash
up() {
	(($# == 0)) && cd .. && return
	[[ $1 == / ]] && cd / && return

	# shellcheck disable=SC2164
	cd "${PWD%"${PWD##*/"$1"/}"}"
}
```

My modifications are a result of combining the functionalities of these two `up` functions. 

It's also just another excuse to fiddle with my Zsh config and do some light Bash scripting. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

### [Jonathan Suh's Terminal Colors for Bash (jonsuh on GitHub)](https://gist.github.com/jonsuh/3c89c004888dfc7352be)

Instead of writing ANSI escape codes manually, use this simple list of 15 colors and a reset value in your shell config.
